      "The slowest and dullest of the trilogy, which inadvertently breaks a few of the unstated rules of the narrative structure established in the first two films still is the most enduring and memorable of the three. It goes maybe to the fierce, unbridled honesty of the film, whereas the other two could be chalked up to heartwarming fiction.",
      "Linklater ends the film on the most beautiful of conundrums, giving solace to optimists while making sure that realists understand that nothing is far from being alright."

    content: [
      "The film makes you aware of the ability of the filmmaker to manipulate the audience. Audience's opinion of the fall would shift by the mere tweaking of the tools that makeup what cinema is. Instead of revealing the mystery, the director makes you aware of the fallacy that story-telling is. And that you can never escape the fact that no matter what you do, you can never really know the truth. No matter how hard you study it's Anatomy you'll never unravel the truth of the Fall."

  'cigarettes-and-coffee': {
    content: [
      "Three narratives connected with the thread of a 20 dollar bill & surrounded by the tradition of cigarettes & coffee. The film outdoes itself in terms of the cinematography, editing & storyline each aiding in the interleaving of the plots in the minimal scope of a diner on a freeway. PTA leaves us with opaque character motivations resulting the viewer to make sense of the hidden innuendos throughout the film.",
      "Dialogues seems to come out of a template American screenplay in which gravitas is emphasised more than the substance. The dramatization & structurization makes for an interesting short however it's intentions and conclusions are quite elusive."
