      "The slowest and dullest of the trilogy, which inadvertently breaks a few of the unstated rules of the narrative structure established in the first two films still is the most enduring and memorable of the three. It goes maybe to the fierce, unbridled honesty of the film, whereas the other two could be chalked up to heartwarming fiction.",
      "Linklater ends the film on the most beautiful of conundrums, giving solace to optimists while making sure that realists understand that nothing is far from being alright."

      "The film makes you aware of the ability of the filmmaker to manipulate the audience. Audience's opinion of the fall would shift by the mere tweaking of the tools that makeup what cinema is. Instead of revealing the mystery, the director makes you aware of the fallacy that story-telling is. And that you can never escape the fact that no matter what you do, you can never really know the truth. No matter how hard you study it's Anatomy you'll never unravel the truth of the Fall."

    content: [
      "Three narratives connected with the thread of a 20 dollar bill & surrounded by the tradition of cigarettes & coffee. The film outdoes itself in terms of the cinematography, editing & storyline each aiding in the interleaving of the plots in the minimal scope of a diner on a freeway. PTA leaves us with opaque character motivations resulting the viewer to make sense of the hidden innuendos throughout the film.",
      "Dialogues seems to come out of a template American screenplay in which gravitas is emphasised more than the substance. The dramatization & structurization makes for an interesting short however it's intentions and conclusions are quite elusive."

      "A film that is corresponded with the likes of Dil Chahta Hai & Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara sure does fall a little short of those classics but is fresh and one of the most relevant subjects of the decade. All in all the film is a mixed bag with it nailing the aesthetics and world building revolving around the contemporary present day influencer culture. The credit for the impressive performances goes to the actors as well as the commendable casting choice of the lead characters.",
      "The film does surely lack the longevity of the predecessor classics and fails in imbuing the same hopeful and inspirational message that makes them a go-to feel good staple. But that does speaks also to the present attention span lacking and content consuming era we are in.",
      "The conflicts of the film feel half-baked and could've been a little more immaculate. The conclusion of the second half was also somewhat hasty resulting in the movie coming off a little preachy.",
      "The vibes surely live up to the characteristic Zoya Akhtar benchmark and is a great feel-good piece of contemporary film."
