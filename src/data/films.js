    content: [
      "A story born from a drunken night and shaped by the dry humour of quiet disappointment.",
      "It observes the small tragedies of rejection and the unlikely comedy woven through them,",
      "never claiming grandeur—only tracing the restless, absurd days of an amateur filmmaker adrift in an engineering college."

    content: [
      "A wilder, more chaotic twin to its predecessor, this film threw caution to the wind.",
      "Its spiralling over our sheer incompetence incompetence—became a kind of meta-revelation,",

      "a process that hovered somewhere between improvisational style and outright stupidity—",
      "yet somehow, in that chaos, the film found its own logic, its own accidental rhythm."

      "a gaze into doubt, insecurity, loneliness, and the prejudice that shapes a childhood far too early.",
      "Told through the eyes of an innocent child, it becomes our own small rendition of Pride Month,",

      "This film drifts through that fear: that if we finally confess the ache, the world might simply shrug and ask Is that all?",
      "It is a portrait of unspoken longing, of emotions too small for grand tragedy",
