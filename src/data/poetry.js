    content: `the three of us
looking in the sky, our toes touching the coast 
me, him and my wife
a familiar stranger who like a lady bug crawled on her arm
reminding her of the day she spent capturing them in a used jam jar
when she was young.

the three of us
me, my husband and him
a garland of vows around our fingers changed me slowly, everyday
from a girl to a woman to a wife, how bad is it..
to steal a glimpse into the girl i left behind, in a pond across my old house 
that i still see in his eyes.

the three of us
for some stupid reason at the crossroad of past and present
me, her and him
why do i feel so out of place and still nostalgic
as if i am revisiting my childhood home which's been 
bought and refurnished by another family years ago
am i an intruder or in a place i truly belong?

here lies on the beach footprints of
the three of us
husband, lost love & the alzheimer riddled wife
the three of us.`

  'kaufmans-hell': {
    content: `as I walk through the street I look into the window 
of a pale pink coloured house 
and girl stands there around 4 maybe 5 
trying on red stilettoes of size 36 maybe 7
she's wearing a headband with a floral print 
similar to the one that's on curtains beside the window
her mother might be into stitching I thought to myself
and maybe the stilettoes are her mother's too 
and maybe the underpants hanged on the balcony with clothespin

 I often think why people get sick and are sick 
are there pills that treat them or are they more like 
flu no pills just wait for a week maybe 2
or cancer no pills just sympathy for being handed a bad hand of cards
I often think it's like AIDS we don't like to talk about and hide it under sheets
for reasons we all know why 

& so I look inwards towards the girl wearing those heeled shoes that don't fit her 
grow and turn into a slut with a different guy each alternate evening 
with an exception of 1 maybe 2 whom she feels curious about
and wonder what the hell is going on in her mind
and how not knowing any girl from a young age 
thinking of a different girl each night whom I saw on the sidewalk or on the balcony or through a window
how does my mind work 

as how the poor kid watches the rich one play with toys she calls guys he doesn't have 
in some Satyajit ray's film one maybe two
and this contextual capitalism spins my mind into a limbo
as I go back to sleep to wake up going to my job 
walking through the same street looking in and seeing my mother her saying
oh! so you came back from school? 

and I am confused I say, no I am just about to go to WORK
she comes close and takes my backpack from over my shoulders
shocked I see in the mirror being turned to a teenager 
and mother wearing the same red stilettoes with a black stocking about to go out
the supper is on the table she says I am going out, I'll return in a few hours
I wonder where is she going? comeback stay!

and so I rummage through her closet for clues and am surprised the shoes there 
along with the dress and stockings
and a woman comes out of the bathroom with wet hair and towel around saying
what are you doing? aren't you ready yet? 
your father will be here any moment, he's almost back from work

and I see myself walking in from work I was supposed to leave for
slowly the world around me starts spinning turning into a vertigo 
and I see myself turned into a cockroach witnessing a hot girl 
in sexy dress and red stilettoes blowing a man off.`

  'white-noise': {
    content: `grey and white pieces on mosaic 

fluttering 
shadows and whisps casted on a high pixeled screen 
I listen through those ears – 
between the fingers 
of fork and spoon pitched, the noise of silence
they creep 
as hands in between hands 
or a church choir band 
…and? I weep.`
