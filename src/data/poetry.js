    content: `the three of us
looking in the sky, our toes touching the coast 
me, him and my wife
a familiar stranger who like a lady bug crawled on her arm
reminding her of the day she spent capturing them in a used jam jar
when she was young.

the three of us
me, my husband and him
a garland of vows around our fingers changed me slowly, everyday
from a girl to a woman to a wife, how bad is it..
to steal a glimpse into the girl i left behind, in a pond across my old house 
that i still see in his eyes.

the three of us
for some stupid reason at the crossroad of past and present
me, her and him
why do i feel so out of place and still nostalgic
as if i am revisiting my childhood home which's been 
bought and refurnished by another family years ago
am i an intruder or in a place i truly belong?

here lies on the beach footprints of
the three of us
husband, lost love & the alzheimer riddled wife
the three of us.`

  'play': {
    content: `Play
You sit together, speaking in soft circles,
 and from a distance I watch you—
 wondering if creatures like me were never taught
 how to sit beside you.
When you talk, what is it that you talk about?
 When you laugh, does it rise from the heart,
 or only from the lips?
 If it is real, then I am content here;
 I have known the weight of genuine laughter.
But when you search for a smile
 on a face that has forgotten how to wear one,
 I feel the pull of this stage
 and the play you call life—
 a play I, too, wish to stumble into.
You paint one side of your body white
 and the other black,
 and call it honesty.
 I tremble at my own shadow—
 how can I bear two faces
 when even one is too much?
I have never understood
 the silence hidden inside
 someone else's silence.
 Perhaps that is why
 I never learned to speak to you.
I've heard you craft new faces
 as easily as masks.
 I've heard you teach the art
 of the lies beneath conversation.
 I've heard you write the stories
 others live in,
 the ones people gather to watch.
Write one for me as well.
 I do not seek fame—
 I simply do not know how to live.
What was that?
 You say you do not know how to write?
A Play.`

Far from here, where truth bends to kiss the feet of lies,
 I am walking toward that distance.
On a trembling shore, I carve three names in sand—
 a border between what is honest
 and what has learned to pretend.
 I surrender a silence, a tear, and a solitude
 in the shape of your name.
If you ever arrive,
 you will find that tear hardened into a pearl,
 and from that one small shining bead
 all you will understand.
Your silence will rise in my eyes,
 and in their drought
 you will glimpse rivers that once knew how to flood.
I leave you nothing but solitude.
 Like a brief wind through your dunes,
 I will move on.
In an empty pocket I carry
 a silver earring, a broken cigarette, a withered flower.
 Their kinship belongs neither to imagination nor reality—
 it breathes only in solitude.
 Imagination burns. Reality rests.
 The past sulks in a corner.
The flower gave me solitude;
 I returned the gift and handed solitude a flower.
 The earring weighed me down;
 I lifted its burden, lighting cigarette's spark.
The cigarette broke.
 The flower dried.
 The earlobe kept its small bruise.
 And I stopped digging at wounds
 that no longer hurt.
On that shore remain:
 a silver earring
 a broken cigarette
 a dried flower
 and a single footprint
 still deciding whom it belonged to.`

    content: `2 flights
we boarded two different flights for the same city and between the span of 2 hours spread over two days our relationship changed 
i started calling her by her nick name 
and those eyes were gone who said they don't know me anymore .
and when i inquired knocking on the door there was no response, i guess some things never change 
like the shimmer of her eyes or the thin squeaky voice or the ketchup on her top, which i saw but ignored like the black mole on her chin 
but know when i dream i don't dream her eating or the clumsy, irritatingly yapping 
i dream often about her hair dyed pink or the ear-rings she started wearing
taunting me from behind those pinks dancing daffodils in the wind
for i no longer have the consent to tug those dancing hair behind the ears
and they are no longer familiar
why do you think i have grown out my hair 
and have started wearing black 
pink is the colour of love and of your hair
i am happy in the black of despair`

    content: `The Aviary
Birds, one by one, wove a tapestry of nests,
After three monsoons, and four rains,
They turned that rooftop into a home.
Each bird watched how,
From inside the window, a poet sat stealing their stories.
When the wind blew, all pages flew out the window,
At first, the birds thought the poet's tales were lost in reality.
The rain was heavy, and a bird took flight behind the pages,
But upon return, the nest was empty.
After a while, peering through the window, a cage hung in the room.
There,
The poet was being gazed by the bird.
Indeed, the affair between the poet and the bird had been going on for quite some time.
This fact was now understood by the other bird.
In reality, those were not poems but love letters that the poet had addressed to the bird.
He stole moments, not stories,
Just as another bird stole glances at him.
The love of a poet had captured a bird,
While the betrayal of one bird had set another free.
Was the protagonist of the tale, poet or the bird?
Like the title of this tale, was it love or betrayal?
The Aviary.`
